# Got A Beat Demo App

Music producers with approved accounts can upload instrumentals (WAV or AIFF files) which are easy to listen to, scroll through, and search by bpm, or by mood, or by most-or-least-often used.

Each beat shows a waveform that lets you click to different points in the instrumental, and have a “License” button next to it, which takes you to a page giving you three options of license types “Single Use”, “Non-Exclusive License” and “Exclusive License”.
